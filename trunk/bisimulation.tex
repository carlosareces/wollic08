Here we will define a proper notion of bisimulation for
$\HL(\remember,\known,\erase,\forget)$ and
$\ML_\emptyset(\remember,\known)$, and use it to investigate their
expressive power.  We will use a presentation in terms of
Ehrenfeucht games~\cite{ebbi:math84}, and an alternative relational
presentation.

We start with some notation. Given $\model= \diam{W, \rels, V, S}$
and states $w_1,\dots,w_n$, we define $\model[w_1,\dots,w_n] =
\diam{W, \rels, V, S \cup \{ w_1,\dots,w_n\}}$.
The set of propositions that are true at a given state $w$ is defined as
$\props(w) = \{p \in \prop \mid w \in V(p)\}$. Given two models $\model= \diam{W, \rels, V, S}$ and $\model'= \diam{W', \relsp, V', S'}$, and
states $w \in W$ and $w' \in W'$, we say that they {\em agree} if $\props(w)=\props(w')$ and $w\in S$ iff $w'
\in S'$.

\paragraph{Bisimulation Games for {\em $\ML(\remember,\known)$}} Let $S = \diam{\prop, \rel}$ be a standard modal signature. Let
$\model_1=\diam{W_1,\relsu,V_1,S_1}$ and
$\model_2=\diam{W_2,\relsd,V_2,S_2}$ be models and let $w_1 \in W_1$
and $w_2 \in W_2$ be agreeing states. We define the
\emph{Ehrenfeucht game} $E(\model_1, \model_2, w_1, w_2)$ as
follows. There are two players called \emph{Spoiler} and
\emph{Duplicator}. In a play of the game, the players move
alternatively. Spoiler always makes the first move. At every move,
Spoiler starts by choosing in which model he will make a move.
Let us set $s=1$ and $d=2$ in case he chooses
$\model_1$; otherwise, let $s=2$ and $d=1$. He can then
either:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a \emph{memorizing step}. I.e.,
he extends $S_s$ to $S_s \cup \{w_s\}$. The game then continues
with  $E(\model_1[w_1], \model_2[w_2],
w_1, w_2)$.

\item Make a \emph{move step}. I.e., he chooses $r \in \rel$, and $v_s$, an $R^s_r$-successor of $w_s$. If $w_s$ has no $R^s_r$-successors, then Duplicator wins. Duplicator has to chose $v_d$, an
$R^d_r$-successor of $w_d$, such that $v_s$ and $v_d$ agree. If there is
no such successor, Spoiler wins. Otherwise the game continues with
$E(\model_1, \model_2,
v_1, v_2)$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
In the case of an infinite game, Duplicator wins. Note
that with this definition, exactly one of Spoiler or Duplicator wins
each game.

%\begin{defn}[Game Bisimulation]
Let $w_1 \in \model_1$ and $w_2 \in \model_2$. We say that $w_1$ and $w_2$ are {\em
g-bisimilar} when they agree
and Duplicator has a winning strategy on $E(\model_1, \model_2, w_1,
w_2)$.

%An $n$\textit{-round} \textit{Ehrenfeucht game} (with $n \geq 0$) is
%defined with the same rules as the standard game, but Spoiler wins
%only when Duplicator cannot exhibit an appropriate successor at his
%$k$-th move, for some $k \leq n$. If Duplicator can respond in his
%$n$-th move, then he wins the game. We note an $n$-round game as
%$E_n(\model_1, \model_2, w_1, w_2)$. The game $E_0(\model_1,
%\model_2, w_1, w_2)$ is always won by Duplicator.

%\begin{defn}[$n$-Bisimulation]
%We say that two models $\model_1$ and $\model_2$ are $n$-bisimilar
%(and we write $\model_1 \bisim_n \model_2$) when there exists $w_1 \in \model_1$
%and $w_2 \in \model_2$ such that they agree and Duplicator has a
%winning strategy on $E_n(\model_1, \model_2, w_1, w_2)$. In this
%case we will also say that $w_1$  and $w_2$ are $n$-bisimilar
%($\model_1, w_1 \bisim_n \model_2, w_2$).
%\end{defn}

We now give an alternative definition of bisimulation, from an
estructural point of view

\paragraph{Structural Bisimulation for {\em $\ML(\remember,\known)$}}
Let $\model$ and $\nodel$ be two $\tl$ models in a signature $S =
\diam{\prop, \rel}$. Let $\sim$ be a binary relation between $\wp(M)
\times M$ and $\wp(N) \times N$. So $\sim$ relates tuples
$\diam{\{m_1, m_2, \dots\}, m}$ with $\diam{\{n_1, n_2, \dots\},
n}$. We write these tuples as $\diam{\bar{m}, m}$. A non-empty
relation $\sim$ is called an \textit{s-bisimulation} if it satisfies
the following properties:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
(\textit{prop}) & \textrm{If } \diam{\bar{m}, m} \sim \diam{\bar{n}, n} \textrm{, then } m \in V^\model(a) \textrm{ iff } n \in V^\nodel(a) \textrm{, for } a \in \prop \\
(\textit{known}) & \textrm{If } \diam{\bar{m}, m} \sim \diam{\bar{n}, n} \textrm{, then } m \in \bar{m} \textrm{ iff } n \in \bar{n}\\
(\textit{forth}) & \textrm{If } \diam{\bar{m}, m} \sim \diam{\bar{n}, n} \textrm{ and } R^\model(m,m') \textrm{, then there exists } n' \in N \textrm{ such that } R^\nodel(n,n') \\
& \textrm{and } \diam{\bar{m}, m'} \sim \diam{\bar{n}, n'}\\
(\textit{back}) & \textrm{A similar condition from } \nodel \textrm{ to } \model\\
(\remember) & \textrm{If } \diam{\bar{m}, m} \sim \diam{\bar{n}, n} \textrm{, then } \diam{\bar{m} \cup \{m\}, m} \sim \diam{\bar{n} \cup \{n\}, n}\\
\end{array}
$$


We can prove that the two definitions are equivalent:

\begin{thm}\label{thm:equiv-g-s}
Given to models $\model_1=\diam{W_1,R_1,S_1,V_1}$ and
$\model_2=\diam{W_2,R_2,S_2,V_2}$, and two states $w_1 \in W_1$ and
$w_2 \in W_2$, $w_1$ and $w_2$ are g-bisimilar iff
$\diam{S_1,w_1} \sim \diam{S_2, w_2}$ is a s-bisimulation.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
For the right to left direction. Assume that $\diam{S_1,w_1} \sim
\diam{S_2, w_2}$ is an s-bisimulation. We will prove that there is a
strategy for Duplicator in the game $\game$. First note that the
game $\game$ is well defined, since by \textit{(prop)} and
\textit{(known)}, $w_1$ and $w_2$ are agreeing states. We show that
there is a strategy for Duplicator by proving that $(1)$ for any
pair of tuples $\diam{S,w}$ and $\diam{Q,v}$ such that $\diam{S,w}
\sim \diam{Q,v}$, and for any Spoiler step in the game
$E(\model_1[S], \model_2[Q], w, v)$, there is always an appropriate
answer for Duplicator such that the next step of the game is
$E(\model_1[S'], \model_2[Q'], w', v')$ and $\diam{S',w'} \sim
\diam{Q',v'}$. Given the initial assumptions, the fact that
Duplicator has a winning strategy on the game $\game$ easily follows
from $(1)$. So let's suppose that $\diam{S,w} \sim \diam{Q,v}$ and
consider the game $E(\model_1[S], \model_2[Q], w, v)$. Without loss
of generality, we assume that Spoiler chooses $\model_1$ to make his
move. There are three kinds of moves Spoiler can do:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Spoiler chooses to make a memorizing step, so the game goes on with $E(\model_1[S \cup \{w\}], \model_2[Q \cup \{v\}],w,v)$. By the $(\remember)$ condition, we know that $\diam{S \cup \{w\}, w} \sim \diam{Q \cup \{v\}, v}$.
\item Spoiler chooses to make a move step, so he chooses an $R$-succesor $w'$ of $w$. By the \textit{(forth)} condition (we should use \textit{(back)} here if we would have supposed that Duplicator chooses $\model_2$ to make his move), there is an $R$-succesor $v'$ of $v$ such that $\diam{S,w'} \sim \diam{Q,v'}$. Using \textit{(prop)} and \textit{(known)}, we know that $w'$ and $v'$ agree, so $v'$ is a good choice for Duplicator, the next step of the game is $E(\model_1[S], \model_2[Q], w', v')$ and $\diam{S,w'} \sim \diam{Q,v'}$.
%\item Spoiler chooses to make a jump step, so he chooses any named state $w'$ of $\model_1$. Because $w'$ is named, there is a nominal $i$ that names $w'$. Because the signature is the same for both models, we know there is a $v'$ in $\model_2$ such that $i$ names $v'$. By the $(@)$ condition, we know that $\diam{S,w'} \sim \diam{Q,v'}$, so $v'$ is a good choice for Duplicator, because by \textit{(prop)} and \textit{(known)} $w'$ and $v'$ agree. The next step of the game is $E(\model_1[S], \model_2[Q], w', v')$ and $\diam{S,w'} \sim \diam{Q,v'}$.
\end{itemize}

For the other direction, let's suppose that Duplicator has a winning
strategy $\mathcal{S}$ on the game $\game$, where
$\model_1=\diam{W_1,R_1,S_1,V_1}$ and
$\model_2=\diam{W_2,R_2,S_2,V_2}$. We are going to define an
s-bisimulation relation $\sim$ in the following way: $\diam{S,w} \sim
\diam{Q,v}$ iff $E(\model_1[S], \model_2[Q],w,v)$ is some stage of
the game $\game$ reached by the players when Duplicator follows the
strategy $\mathcal{S}$.

So now we have to see that the relation $\sim$ we defined is
actually an s-bisimulation. Suppose that $\diam{S,w} \sim \diam{Q,v}$.
Using the definition of $\sim$, that means that $E(\model_1[S],
\model_2[Q],w,v)$ is a reacheable game state from $\game$ when
Duplicator uses the strategy $\mathcal{S}$. Let's check the
bisimulation conditions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The conditions \textit{(prop)} and \textit{(known)} are easy to see, given that the definition of $\sim$ implies that if $\diam{S,w} \sim \diam{Q,v}$ then $w$ and $v$ are agreeing states.
\item To see that the \textit{(forth)} condition holds, suppose that $R^\model(m,m')$. One possible move for Spoiler in the game $E(\model_1[S], \model_2[Q],w,v)$ is to choose $m'$ from $\model_1$, and because Duplicator uses the winning strategy $\mathcal{S}$, he can answer with a state $v' \in \model_2$, a succesor of $v$, such that $w'$ and $v'$ agree. Therefore, the next step of the game is $E(\model_1[S], \model_2[Q], w', v')$, and by definition, $\diam{S,w'} \sim \diam{Q,v'}$. The \textit{(back)} condition is equivalent.
%\item To see $(@)$, note that for every nominal $i \in \nom$, Spoiler can make a jump state and move to $w'$, a state named by $i$ (and without losing generality we can suppose that $w' \in \model_1$). Using $\mathcal{S}$, Duplicator can answer with a state $v' \in \model_2$, such that $w'$ and $v'$ agree, and the next step of the game is $E(\model_1[S], \model_2[Q], w', v')$. Therefore $\diam{S,w'} \sim \diam{Q,v'}$ by definition.
\item Finally, to see the $(\remember)$ condition, note that in the game $E(\model_1[S], \model_2[Q],w,v)$ Spoiler can choose to make a memorizing step, and therefore the next step of the game is $E(\model_1[S \cup \{w\}], \model_2[Q \cup \{v\}],w,v)$. By definition, that means that $\diam{S\cup\{w\},w} \sim \diam{Q \cup \{v\},v}$.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, $\sim$ is actually an s-bisimulation. Because the game
$\game$ is a (trivial) reachable stage of itself, $\diam{S_1,w} \sim
\diam{S_2,v}$ as desired.
\end{pf}

We now define what bisimulation between two models is. Of course, given Theorem~\ref{thm:equiv-g-s},
we can equivalently use the game or structural notions.

\begin{defn}[Bisimulation]
We say that two models $\model_1$ and $\model_2$ are {\em
bisimilar} (and we write $\model_1 \bisim \model_2$) iff
there exist g-bisimilar $w_1 \in \model_1$ and $w_2 \in \model_2$.
In this case we also say that $w_1$  and $w_2$ are {\em
bisimilar} ($\model_1, w_1 \bisim \model_2, w_2$).
\end{defn}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We are now ready to prove that the notion of bisimulation
we just introduced is adequate.  We will show that formulas
of $\ML(\remember,\known)$ are preserved under bisimulation.


\begin{defn}[Logic equivalence]
Given $\model_1,\model_2$ two models, $w_1 \in \model_1$, $w_2 \in
\model_2$, we say that $w_1$ is {\em equivalent} (for some logic $\mathcal{L}$) to $w_2$ ($w_1
\leftrightsquigarrow w_2$) if for all $\varphi$ (in $\mathcal{L}$) we have
$\model_1,w_1\models\varphi$ iff $\model_2,w_2\models\varphi$.
% We
% say that $w_1$ is {\em $n$-equivalent} to $w_2$ ($w_1
% \leftrightsquigarrow_n w_2$) if for all $\varphi$ such that
% $\deg(\varphi)\leq n$ we have $\model_1,w_1\models\varphi$ iff
% $\model_2,w_2\models\varphi$.
\end{defn}



\begin{thm}\label{bisim}
Let $\model_1,\model_2$ be two models, $w_1 \in \model_1, w_2 \in
\model_2$. If $w_1 \bisim w_2$ then $w_1 \leftrightsquigarrow w_2$.
\end{thm}

\begin{pf}
We prove that if $w_1$ and $w_2$ agree and Duplicator has a winning
strategy on $E(\model_1, \model_2, w_1, w_2)$ then $\forall \varphi
\in \tl, \, \model_1, w_1 \models \varphi \; \iff \; \model_2, w_2
\models \varphi$. We proceed by induction on $\varphi$.

\begin{itemize}
\item The propositional and boolean cases are trivial.

\item $\varphi = \known$. This case follows from Definition~\ref{semantics}
and because $w_1$ and $w_2$ agree.

\item $\varphi = \diam{r} \psi$. This is the standard modal case.
Preservation is ensured thanks to the \emph{move steps} in the
definition of the game.
%We prove that $\model_1,w_1 \models
%\diam{R} \psi$ implies $\model_2,w_2 \models \diam{R} \psi$. Suppose
%$\model_1,w_1 \models \diam{R} \psi$. Then there is $v_1\in
%\model_1$ such that $w_1R_1v_1$ and $\model_1,v_1\models\psi$.
%Suppose that Spoiler chooses model $\model_1$ at step 1, not to
%remember the current world at step 2 and $v_1$ as an $R_1$-successor
%at step 3. Following Duplicator's winning strategy on $E(\model_1,
%\model_2, w_1, w_2)$, he finds $v_2$ agreeing with $v_1$,
%$w_2R_2v_2$ and keeps a winning strategy on $E(\model_1, \model_2,
%v_1, v_2)$. By inductive hypothesis and the fact that
%$\model_1,v_1\models\psi$, we conclude $\model_2,v_2\models\psi$ and
%therefore $\model_2,w_2\models\diam{R} \psi$. The other direction is
%identical.

\item $\varphi = \remember \psi$. We prove that
$\model_1,w_1 \models \remember \psi$ implies $\model_2,w_2 \models
\remember \psi$. Suppose $\model_1,w_1 \models \remember \psi$ then
$\model_1[w_1],w_1 \models \psi$. The following claim is clear.

\bigskip

\noindent
\textbf{Claim.} Let $\model_1,\model_2$ be two models, $w_1 \in \model_1,w_2
\in \model_2$. If Duplicator has a winning
strategy on $\game$ then he has a winning strategy on
$E(\model_1[w_1], \model_2[w_2], w_1, w_2)$.

\bigskip


By this claim,
Duplicator has a winning strategy on $E(\model_1[w_1],
\model_2[w_2], w_1,$ $w_2)$. Applying inductive hypothesis and the
fact that $\model_1[w_1],w_1 \models \psi$, we conclude
$\model_2[w_2], w_2 \models \psi$  and then $\model_2, w_2 \models
\remember\psi$. The other direction is identical.
\end{itemize}
This concludes the proof.
\end{pf}

% \begin{thm}\label{thm:bisim-n-to-modal-n}
% Let $\model_1,\model_2$ be two models, $w_1 \in \model_1, w_2 \in
% \model_2$. If $w_1 \bisim_n w_2$ then $w_1 \leftrightsquigarrow_n
% w_2$.
% \end{thm}
%
% \begin{pf}
% The proof can be done by induction on $n$, following the same idea
% as in Theorem~\ref{bisim}.
% \end{pf}
%
% \begin{thm}\label{thm:bisim-n-to-prune}
% Let $\model$ be a model and $w \in \model$. For every $n \geq 0$,
% $\model, w \bisim_n (\model \upharpoonright n), w$.
% \end{thm}
%
% \begin{pf}
% It is easy to see that in an $n$-round game the players only visit
% states with height at most $n$ and thus, as far as the players are
% concerned, $\model$ and $\model\upharpoonright n$ are the same.
% Therefore Duplicator can always copy Spoiler's move.
% \end{pf}

The converse of Theorem~\ref{bisim} holds for image-finite models
(i.e., models in which the set of successors
of any state in the domain is finite). The proof is exactly the
same as for $\mathcal{K}$, as $\remember$ and $\known$ do not
interact with the accessibility relation~\cite{BRV01}.

\begin{thm}[Hennessy-Milner Theorem]\label{thm:hennesy} Let
$\model_1$ and $\model_2$ be two image finite models. Then for every
$w_1 \in \model_1$ and $w_2 \in \model_2$, $w_1 \leftrightsquigarrow
w_2$ then $w_1 \bisim w_2$.
\end{thm}

%\begin{pf}
%We prove that the relation
%$\leftrightsquigarrow$ of modal equivalence induces at any stage of the game, the next step in Duplicator's strategy. We prove that for any $\model_1', \model_2', w_1'\in\model_1', w_2'\in\model_2'$ such that $\model_1',w_1' \leftrightsquigarrow \model_2',w_2'$, and for any $v_1\in\model_1'$ that Spoiler selects, Duplicator can always answer $v_2\in\model_2'$ such that $\model_1',v_1\leftrightsquigarrow \model_2',v_2$ (and symmetrically in the case Spoiler chooses $\model_2'$). Suppose
%Spoiler chooses $\model_1'$ to play.
%\begin{enumerate}
%item Suppose Spoiler decides to take a \emph{move step}.  He
%chooses $v_1$, an $R$-successor of $w_1'$. Assume by contradiction
%that Duplicator cannot respond back. This means that he cannot
%exhibit $v_2$, an $R$-successor of $w_2'$, such that
%$\model_1',v_1 \leftrightsquigarrow \model_2',v_2$.
%Suppose $\{u_1, \dots, u_n\}$ are the successors of $w_2'$. Let
%$\psi_1, \dots, \psi_n$ be formulas such that $\model_2', u_i
%\not\models \psi_i$ and $\model_1',v_1 \models \psi_i$. It follows
%that $\model_1', w_1' \models \diam{R}(\psi_1 \land \dots \land
%\psi_n)$ and $\model_2', w_2' \not \models \diam{R}(\psi_1 \land
%\dots \land \psi_n)$.  This is a contradiction, since we supposed
%$\model_1',w_1' \leftrightsquigarrow \model_2',w_2'$.

%\item Suppose Spoiler decides to remember $w_1'$. As in the above
%case, there are formulas $\psi_1,\dots,\psi_n$ such that
%$\model_1'[w'_1], w_1' \models \diam{R}(\psi_1 \land \dots \land
%\psi_n)$ and $\model_2'[w_2'], w_2' \not \models \diam{R}(\psi_1
%\land \dots \land \psi_n)$. By definition, $\model_1', w_1' \models
%\remember\diam{R}(\psi_1 \land \dots \land \psi_n)$ and $\model_2',
%w_2' \not \models \remember\diam{R}(\psi_1 \land \dots \land
%\psi_n)$ and we arrive to the same contradiction as in the previous
%case.
%\end{enumerate}
%This concludes the proof.
%\end{pf}

Clearly, as Theorems~\ref{bisim} and~\ref{thm:hennesy} hold for
arbitrary models, the results hold also for $\ML_\emptyset(\remember,\known)$.
